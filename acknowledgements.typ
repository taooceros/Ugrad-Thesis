How can I be more grateful about what is happening at Madison? I cannot write a thesis that is comparable to what I have experienced here .

I would like to start by thanking my advisor, Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau. I feel incredibly lucky to have met and worked with him - my timing couldn't have been better, as my OS class turned out to be one of the last classes he would be teaching for many years. Had I come just one year later, I would have missed Remzi (though he probably wouldn't have had to deal with this annoying undergraduate anymore!). I still remember pestering him with philosophical questions about consensus numbers. Even though he couldn't answer right away, weeks later --- after I had completely forgotten about it --- he brought it up during our meeting.

Remzi has always been a great mentor and a friend. As an undergrad, my work hours have fluctuated, but he is always patient and supportive. He is also incredibly open to what I am doing, and supportive when I decide to switch my programming stack, which takes weeks to finish but probably wouldn't have any research value. Remzi is very picky about the experiments, from which I have learned so much.

I also owe a huge thanks to Yuvraj Patel. Yuvraj has been incredibly supportive to me. I still remember our very long email conversations every day during the first winter we got in touch with each other, despite the time difference. It is incredibly patient of him to answer all my long and tedious questions through emails, one by one. He literally dragged me into the field of concurrency, filling the gap that we don't have an in-depth concurrency course at Madison. Yuvraj always asked me what the problem was, pulling me out from subtle details to see the big picture. This thesis would never become what it is without his help.

I want to thank my systems friends, Thomason Zhao and Yibo Wu. Concurrency has been a field that is very hard to debug. Once I faced a bug#footnote[a very stupid memory bug, but sometimes those are the hardest to debug.] that I could not resolve for weeks. Without their help, it might take me months. I also want to thank many of my other CS friends, Boyuan Zou, Ruixuan Tu, Zhilin Du, Linrong Cai, Feijun Chen and many more. It has been incredibly interesting to have you all in my undergraduate life. I also want to thank Lulu Jin for the various valuable help with my writing.

It has also been lucky for me to meet so many wonderful professors: Stephen Wright, Dieter van Melkebeek, Loris D'Antoni, Erik Bates, Paul Apisa, and many many more. All of you have been incredibly supportive and patient with me, regardless of how many questions I asked. It would take another thesis to write about the stories among us.

Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Hilldale Fellowship for their generous funding toward my research.
